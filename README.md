# IT Security Class

These are my lecture notes from the IT Security course at the Leibniz University of Hannover.
While these may very well be incomplete, I reason sharing them might benefit someone somewhere.

The answeres to all questions are blured, until one hovers the mouse over them.
This has two consequences:
- These html pages are quite useful to study.
- This doesn't work on mobile, until the CSS is getting some edits

Have a beautiful day!
