    <h1>Foundations of Computer Security</h1>
    <hr/>
    <br/>

    <h3>Name two Reasons, why increasing Security is hard</h3>
    <p> It's hard to
        <span>predict</span> vulnerabilitys,
        <br> Security needs to protect against
        <span>everything</span>,
        <br>Attacker only needs to find
        <span>one</span> vulnerability
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What are the (traditional) Goals of Security?</h3>
    <p>Confidentiality
        <br>Integrity
        <br>Availability
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Name (three) further Goals</h3>
    <p>
        Accountability
        <br>Authenticity
        <br>Anonimity
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Where to realize Computer Security?</h3>
    <p>
        Physical World
        <br>Hardware
        <br>Software
        <br>Network
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Why can Security fail in pratice?</h3>
    <p>
        <span>Design</span> might be good,
        <span>implementation</span> has flaws</p>
